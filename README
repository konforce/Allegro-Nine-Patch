 Allegro Nine Patch, by Matthew Leverton, (C) 2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (requires Allegro 5)

= ABOUT =

A nine patch image is a regular image with a special one pixel border. The 
border along the top marks areas that can be stretched horizontally. The 
border along the left marks areas that can be stretched vertically. The borders
along the right and bottom can be used to define internal padding (i.e., the
area on which things can be drawn on top of the bitmap).

The image on the left is 3x3 nine patch image. The X marks the stretchable
areas. The image on the right is a 5x5 version. Note that the middle column
has been stretched horizontally, while the lower two rows were stretched
horizontally.

  ..X..    ABBBC
  .ABC.    DEEEF
  XDEF.    DEEEF
  XGHI.    GHHHI
  .....    GHHHI

You can have as many stretchable areas as you would like. If the above image
is altered to have two stretchable areas, the new 5x5 image will have 
two stretched areas around the middle row.

  ..X..    ABBBC
  XABC.    ABBBC
  .DEF.    DEEEF
  XGHI.    GHHHI
  .....    GHHHI
  
This library can load nine patch images and draw them at any size (equal to or 
larger than the minimum size as defined by the image file).

The border must be 1 pixel wide along each side and entirely transparent, except
for pure black (i.e., rgba(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)) pixels that mark stretchable
areas. 

= STRUCTURES =

NINE_PATCH_BITMAP 

NINE_PATCH_PADDING 
  int top, right, bottom, left;
  
= API =

NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *load_nine_patch_bitmap(const char *filename);

  Loads a nine patch bitmap from an image file. Returns NULL if the image was not
  a valid nine patch bitmap.

NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *create_nine_patch_bitmap(ALLEGRO_BITMAP *bmp, bool owns_bitmap);

  Creates a nine patch bitmap from an ALLEGRO_BITMAP. The bitmap must not be destroyed
  while the nine patch is in use. If the bitmap should automatically be destroyed
  when the nine patch bitmap is destroyed, then set owns_bitmap to true.

void draw_nine_patch_bitmap(NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *p9, int dx, int dy, int dw, int dh);

  Draws a nine patch bitmap to the target bitmap at the dx,dy coordinates with 
  dimensions dw,dh. If either dimension is shorter than the minimum, then nothing
  will be drawn.

ALLEGRO_BITMAP *create_bitmap_from_nine_patch(NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *p9, int w, int h);

  Returns an ALLEGRO_BITMAP created from the nine patch bitmap with the specified
  dimensions w,h. 

int get_nine_patch_bitmap_width(const NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *p9);

  Returns the width of the natural size bitmap. (Excludes the edge columns.)

int get_nine_patch_bitmap_height(const NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *p9);

  Returns the height of the natural size bitmap. (Excludes the edge rows.)

int get_nine_patch_bitmap_min_width(const NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *p9);

  Returns the minimum drawable width of the bitmap. 

int get_nine_patch_bitmap_min_height(const NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *p9);

  Returns the minimum drawable height of the bitmap.

ALLEGRO_BITMAP *get_nine_patch_bitmap_source(const NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *p9);

  Returns the source ALLEGRO_BITMAP with the edge rows and columns.

NINE_PATCH_PADDING get_nine_patch_padding(const NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *p9);

  Returns the padding associated with the nine patch image. Note that
  the padding does not affect any of the nine patch drawing routines.

void destroy_nine_patch_bitmap(NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *p9);

  Destroys the nine patch bitmap. If it owns its associated ALLEGRO_BITMAP,
  then it will also be destroyed.
  
= EXAMPLES =

  /* load a nine patch bitmap and draw it to the target bitmap */
  NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *p9 = load_nine_patch_bitmap("button.9.png");
  draw_nine_patch_bitmap(p9, 0, 0, 320, 50);
  
  /* create a nine patch bitmap from an existing ALLEGRO_BITMAP */
  ALLEGRO_BITMAP *bmp = al_load_bitmap("button.9.png");
  NINE_PATCH_BITMAP *p9 = create_nine_patch_bitmap(bmp, false);
  destroy_nine_patch_bitmap(p9);
  // bmp is still valid, since the nine patch does not own it.
  
  /* create an ALLEGRO_BITMAP from a nine patch bitmap */
  ALLEGRO_BITMAP *bmp = create_bitmap_from_nine_patch(p9, 320, 50);
  al_draw_bitmap(bmp, x, y, 0);
